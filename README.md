# Clendar

a Calendar app

--- 

### Why GPL License?

I want Clendar to be open source but I don't want people to republish the app with a different name on the App Store. Please do not fork this project and submit to the App Store under your own account. The GPL requires that you give the original developer credit and it also requires that the modified app also be open source. So please don't do this.
