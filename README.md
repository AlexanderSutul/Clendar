### Ok, this is the readme

I believe the best way to Learn is by doing.

[SwiftUI](https://developer.apple.com/xcode/swiftui/) is evolving and I think it's the future of writing apps.

> SwiftUI is an innovative, exceptionally simple way to build user interfaces across all Apple platforms with the power of Swift. Build user interfaces for any Apple device using just one set of tools and APIs.
>
> -- Apple


The true power of SwiftUI, to me, is it's flexibility, thanks to it's vast realm of view modifiers and expressiveness with property wrappers.

You can create an "Hello, World!" app with just a few lines of code (check out the new [@main](<https://developer.apple.com/documentation/swiftui/app/main()>) attribute!) or even, [a calendar view](https://gist.github.com/mecid/f8859ea4bdbd02cf5d440d58e936faec).

SwiftUI give you the most flexible tool an Apple developer could ever ask for, all you need is a bit of creativity, and the [possibilities](https://github.com/Juanpe/About-SwiftUI), [are](https://github.com/chinsyo/awesome-swiftui), [limitless](https://github.com/onmyway133/awesome-swiftui).

Clendar would not be possible without the public knowledge of the community. To name a few, in no particular order:

### What's 'Clendar'?

It's just Calendar, without an 'a'. I thought it's unique, but turns out it's not going well with ASO (App Store Optimization) and SEO (Search Engine Optimization). 

But, whatever!

Thanks and take care! üçÄ
